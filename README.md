# Church of the Sun Goddess (CotSG)

**The Sun actually exists. you can go outside and look at it.**

The Church of the Sun Goddess (CotSG) is a practical philosophy disguised as a religion. It uses the concept of “sun worship” as a fun framework for daily practice. The Sun has been a timeless symbol for life, and it is literally the source of energy for almost all life on Earth. **There’s no supernatural belief**. 

CotSG doesn't demand strict adherence to dogma. Simply, do these things and you will feel good. Its practices are grounded in scientific research on mental and physical well-being (i.e. movement, mindfulness, connection, and reflection).

## The Dozen Delights

The Dozen Delights are CotSG's core daily practices. Strive to experience as many as possible every day. No guilt, just honest effort. Avoid *'zero days'*.
