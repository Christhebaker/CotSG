## The Problem

Life involves suffering. Not melodramatic suffering - just the regular grinding kind. Your body hurts, you get bored, people annoy you, you want things you can't have, you get things and then they break or disappear. Nothing lasts. Everything changes. That's just how it works.

Most people respond to this by either:
1. Pretending it's not happening (distraction, substances, endless content consumption)
2. Chasing things they think will fix it (money, status, perfect relationship, ideal body)
3. Getting bitter about it

None of these work. The distraction wears off. The thing you chased doesn't satisfy you. Bitterness just makes you miserable *and* unpleasant to be around.

## What Actually Helps

You can't eliminate suffering, but you can reduce it. Not through magical thinking or pretending everything's fine - through basic maintenance and paying attention.

**Physical maintenance:** Your body needs movement, food, water, sunlight, sleep. Neglect any of these and you'll feel like shit. This isn't mystical, it's biology.

**Mental maintenance:** Your brain needs stimulus, challenge, rest, and connection. Give it too much or too little of any of these and it malfunctions.

**The attention part:** Most suffering gets worse when you're not paying attention. You eat garbage because you're distracted. You snap at people because you're on autopilot. You let problems compound because you're avoiding them.

Mindfulness isn't about being zen or peaceful. It's about noticing what's actually happening so you can make better decisions.

## Why Desire Isn't the Enemy

Buddhism says desire causes suffering. Schopenhauer said the same thing - we're driven by endless wanting (he called it "Will") and it never stops.

They're both right about the diagnosis, but the prescription isn't realistic for most people. You're not going to transcend desire. You're a human with a body and a brain that evolved to want things.

The trick is working *with* desire instead of against it:
- You want to feel good physically → movement, nourishment, hydration
- You want novelty and stimulation → curiosity, creation, fun
- You want connection → touch, interaction, charity
- You want growth → struggle, improvement

Channel the wanting into things that actually work instead of things that make it worse.

## Why Struggle Matters

Comfort doesn't make you happy. Comfort makes you soft, then bored, then anxious because you've lost confidence in your ability to handle difficulty.

You need some struggle - not suffering for suffering's sake, but deliberate challenge. Lift something heavy. Learn something hard. Do a thing that scares you a little.

This is Stoicism's main insight: you get stronger by choosing difficulty instead of having it forced on you. And when difficulty *is* forced on you, you're better equipped to handle it.

## Impermanence

Everything ends. Your health, your relationships, your life. The things you own, the places you love, the version of yourself you are right now - all temporary.

This is either depressing or liberating depending on how you look at it.

Depressing: nothing you do matters because it all disappears eventually.

Liberating: nothing you do matters, so you might as well do things that feel good and help people while you're here.

The sun's a good reminder. It rises and sets whether you're paying attention or not. It doesn't care about your problems. It just keeps burning. One day it'll burn out too. In the meantime, it keeps everything alive.

## Why This Isn't a Real Religion

Religions offer cosmic meaning, eternal life, divine justice, answers to big questions. This doesn't.

This is just: do things that reduce suffering, pay attention to what's actually happening, don't be a dick to people, acknowledge that nothing lasts.

The "church" framing is mostly a joke. But jokes work. It's easier to remember "Church of the Sun Goddess" than "evidence-based framework for reducing suffering through daily practices." And having rituals and symbols helps with consistency.

Plus, the sun actually exists and actually keeps you alive. If you're going to worship something, might as well be the giant nuclear furnace that makes photosynthesis possible.

## The Actual Point

You can't fix everything. You can't eliminate suffering. You can't make things permanent. You can't transcend your biology.

What you *can* do:
- Take care of your body
- Pay attention
- Do hard things on purpose
- Help people when you can
- Experience some joy
- Avoid zero days

That's it. No cosmic answers. No promises of enlightenment. Just: these things work better than not doing them.
